  Public API requests
  
  
  This is an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

The Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) is used to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that builds a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.

A JSON object  is generated from the API and parsed so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.


Enhanced features for an Exceeds Expectations grade include:

- Dynamic background color change.
- A search feature so users can be filtered by name.
- A toggle function on the modal pop-up that enables navigation between users withouth closing the box.
